	"summary": "I have always had a fascination with technology since a young age. At twelve I was helping to manage my schools network and fixing computers for friends. This passion only grew as I got older and transformed into a career. Although I spend a lot of free time tinkering, building and crawling /r/sysadmin, I recognise the need to disconnect. From this need I have developed a great love for all things outdoors, especially climbing. I spend a lot of my free time down the local climbing gym and weekends exploring the Lake District and Snowdonia.",
