It's not a job its my lifestyle, when I'm not working you'll find me on Hacker News or r/sysadmin reading up and tinkering with new technology. I'm very security conscious (some might call me paranoid) and would like to move into the security world in the future. I'm a big Open Source advocate, I run Ubuntu with i3 and spend most of my time in an ssh session or Emacs. I'm always trying to convert friends and family to the Open Source world.",
